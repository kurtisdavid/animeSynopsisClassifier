# animeSynopsisClassifier
Multilabel classification of synopses from all the anime listed on MyAnimeList.net

Currently a work in progress, here's a log of what I've done:

**06/22/2017**: Wrote MAL webscraper to collect the synopses of all of their anime to be used in the analysis.
**06/23/2017**: Started IPythonNotebook file that will contain all the steps I took to do this project.
